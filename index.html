                <p>
                    A former K-12 music educator, musicologist, and retail worker, Robert Gassner brings a wide variety
                    of skills to web development. He holds a certificate in full stack web development from the
                    University of Arizona School of Continuing and Professional Education (October 2020), Two Bachelors
                    Degrees (Bachelor of Music: Instrumental Music Education, Bachelor of Science: Music History &
                    Literature) from the Lionel Hampton School of Music at the University of Idaho (May 2014), and a
                    Master of Music (Music History & Literature) from the University of Northern Colorado (May 2019).
                    His work experience has been varied, including teaching stints at both the k-12 and higher education
                    levels, as well as serving as the editorial assistant for a peer reviewed journal, and even three
                    years experience working in the grocery industry. Drawing on these experiences, "R.J.," as he is
                    known to virtually everyone, is a highly collaborative individual with excellent abilities in
                    written
                    and spoken communication, presentation, and time management. He also functions well as an
                    individual, and is not afraid to get down and dirty with research and/or analysis.
                </p>
            
                <p>In the coding world, R.J.'s focus is in web development, though he maintains interests in other areas
                    such as game development. As a musicologist, his research focused on the intersectons of music with
                    politics, diplomacy, and war. His masters thesis "A Topical and Narrative Analysis of Napoleonic Era
                    Battle Pieces" examined music composed during or shortly after the Napoleonic Wars, and analyzed not
                    only the common musical language used by different composers (called "topics" in the musicological
                    world), but also looked at the narrative each composer presented, comparing them to what actually
                    occured. He has also conducted original research on music in the French Revolution (Specifically
                    F.J. Gossec's 1790 Te Deum), and Jean Mouton's "Missa Ecce quam bonum" as it pertains to the heretic
                    fryer Girolamo Savonarola. As a Graduate Student, he served as the editorial assistant for the
                    Journal of Musicological Research. As an educator, he specializes in concert band and music history,
                    and has taught at the Yamhill-Carlton School
                    district in Oregon, and Laramie County Community College in Wyoming. His musical interest include
                    Basie, von Bingen, Borodin, Cicconia, Ellington, Glazunov, Glière, Gossec, Grainger, Janequin,
                    Kenton, Ticheli, Schütz, and Stravinksy, among others.

            <p>When not working, R.J. participates a variety of activities. He enjoys reading, especially about
                history; He is fascinated by things such as geopolitics and diplomacy, and thus makes an effort to
                keep up with current events and world news. He is a gamer, and enjoys not only playing, but
                collecting video games on a variety of systems. He is a passionate fan of the pro sports teams of his
                home town of Portland, OR, especially the Portland Timbers of Major League Soccer. His other, though
                admittedly more causal, sporting interests include the Green Bay Packers, New York Mets, and Cardiff
                City FC, among others.
                R.J. also enjoys outdoor activites, including camping, swimming, and simply exploring new places.
